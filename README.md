📘 India GDP Prediction Project Description (for GitHub)

🇮🇳 India GDP Prediction (1960–2025)

This project uses historical GDP data from India to build a machine learning model that predicts future GDP values. It combines data visualization, regression modeling, and interactive web tools to analyze economic growth and forecast India's GDP in the coming years.

✨ Features:

Visualize India’s GDP growth from 1960 to 2025

Train a Linear Regression model on real GDP data

Predict future GDP (2026 and beyond)

Build a web-based interactive GDP predictor using Streamlit

📂 Files Included:

india_gdp_1960_2025.csv – GDP dataset (with values for 2024–2025 added)

India_GDP_Prediction.ipynb – Jupyter notebook with ML code and plots

india_gdp_app.py – Streamlit app for public interaction

README.md – Project documentation

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

Streamlit (for app UI)

📈 Use Case:

This project demonstrates how AI/ML techniques can be applied to macroeconomic forecasting using publicly available data. It’s ideal for students, researchers, and developers exploring applied machine learning in economics.
